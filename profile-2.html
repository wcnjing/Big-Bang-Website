            <h1 class="heading">ABOUT</h1>
            <p class="indent2">Big Bang(빅뱅) is a South Korean boy band formed by YG Entertainment. They debuted on the 19th of August, 2006 and are still an active band. 
                This group consists of <a href= "#profile-1">G-dragon</a>, <a href= "#profile-4">T.O.P</a>, <a href= "#profile-2">Taeyang</a> and <a href= "#profile-3">Daesung</a>.
                 When the group was first formed, it consisted of 6 members. However, due to 
                the elimination process, only 5 of them were able to debut. In 2019, Seungri, who was originally apart of the band, announced that he was
                leaving the entertainment industry.
                <br><br>
                They are known as 'The Kings of K-pop', being the first K-pop Idol group to have an international audience. They rose to fame
                with their trend-setting music experimentation, self production, and unbeatable stage presence. In the past, idol groups were seen 
                as talentless. When BigBang garnered attention, they proved this sterotype wrong and people started to appreciate K-pop more.
                 They first recieved attention when they released
                their hit song 'Lies' (거짓말) in 2007. They popularised and started a lot of the K-pop trends seen today,
                such as the 'lightstick', as well as spunky hair colours. Even in 2022, after being inactive for over 4 years, 
                Big Bang still managed to break many records with their comeback single 'Still Life'(봄여름가을겨울). </p>

             G-dragon is the leader of bigbang. He stands out with his unique and high-pitched voice. A talented singer, songwrite and
                rapper, his stage name is "G-DRAGON". He chose this
                stage name because
                in Korean, "Ji-yong" means dragon, and "Ji-yong" is pronouced in english as "G-yong." He started as a trainee at S.M. Entertainment 
                at the young age of 8 years. Later, he will go on to become a trainee at YG Entertainment along side another BigBang member, Taeyang.
                They trained together for about 6 years to debut. The two was initially meant to debut as a hip-hop duo, "GDYB", but the plan changed. 
                Instead, BigBang was formed when 3 more members were added. As the leader of BigBang, he contributes heavily. Known for his exceptional song-writing skills, many of BigBang's songs are 
                written by him. Having been song-writing for decades, he is sometimes called a "song-writing genius". 
                <br><br>
                The main rapper is also a fashion icon. He has appeared in numerous leading fashion magazines, such as "Vogue" and "Elle". He is also an
                ambassador for Chanel, a luxury fashion brand. He has always made a big impact in trend-setting, due to his distinctive choices
                of hairstyles and clothing. 
                <br><br>
                Later on in 2009, he made his long awaited solo debut with the album "Heartbreaker". Heartbreaker was a huge hit, selling over 
                300,000 copies and winning Album of the Year at the 2009 Mnet Asia Music Awards. In 2013, he would release his second
                album, "Coup d'Etat". this
                record-breaking album recieved numerous awards, and he went on to reach an international audience with this new release. In the same year,
                he would go on his first solo concert tour, called "One of a kinda World Tour". The tour was the first headlining concert tour by a South Korean
                artist. His next tour was followed shortly after in 2017, "Act III: M.O.T.T.E World Tour". 
                <br><br>
                Due to Korea's military laws, the rapper had to serve his mandatory military service in 2018, and completed his service in late 2019.
                Since then, he has been inactive in the industry. However, he is set to release a long awaited solo album soon in 2023.

              Dong Young-bae is the Main vocalist and Main dancer of Big Bang. He is known for having a strong and soulful voice. Hence, his Japanese stage name
              is "SOL". His style in singing and dancing is highly recognised, and are favourites among other idols. His Japnese stage name is derived from 
              "Taeyang", which means the sun in korean. He dreamt of making people "warm with my music, let it be a light." He frequently references this in his
              albums and songs. He started training at YG Entertainment since he was 12, along side fellow Big Bang member, G-dragon. He is looked up upon by
              many of the vocalists in the K-pop indsutry today.
              <br><br>
              Taeyang is the only married Big Bang member. In 2018, he married Min Hyo-rin. The two have been dating since 2013. The wedding was attended by all
              Big Bang members. The couple had their first son in December 2021. 
              <br><br>
              In 2008, Taeyang made his solo debut with his first mini album 'Hot'. The extended play(EP) was well recieved by both fans and critics, winnning
              2 trophies from the Korean Music Awards. Later in 2010, Taeyang would release his first full-length solo album, "Solar". This album would go on
              to win him "Best Male Artist" award in 2010 at the Mnet Asian Music Awards. It was a huge sucess, and peaked at the number one position on the Gaon Album
              Chart. The singer would have his first solo tour in 2014, along with the release of his second album, "Rise". The Rise World Tour visited 9 countries and 
              16 cites in Asia. That year, his lead single "Eyes, Nose, Lips" won him numerous awards at the Mnet Asian Music Awards, and was the second best-performing 
              single of 2014 in South Korea.
              <br><br>
              The dancer enlisted in the military in 2018, along side fellow member Daesung and G-dragon. He was released in late 2019, and has yet to make a release
              ever since. Earlier in 2022, he has announced he will be releasing a new solo album in the near future, and many fans are excited for his return.
